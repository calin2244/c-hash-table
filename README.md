# üìö `c-hash-table`

## üåü Introduction

Welcome to `c-hash-table`! This is a robust, handcrafted implementation of a Hash Table in C. It's been crafted with love and provides a great foundation for those who are interested in exploring hash tables and their intricacies.

---

## Initialization & Usage Guide
**1. Setting Upüõ†Ô∏è**

Before using the c-hash-table, ensure you include the appropriate header in your source file:
```cpp
#include "hash_map.h"
```
**2. Creating the Hash Tableüì¶8**

The core of this library is the HashTable structure. To create a new hash table, use the ht_create function:

```cpp
HashTable* ht = ht_create(
    CAPACITY,          // Desired capacity
    fnv_hash_func,     // Hash function of choice
    LINEAR_PROBING     // Collision resolution method
);
```
Replace `fnv_hash_func` with your desired hash function and `LINEAR_PROBING` with your chosen collision resolution method.

**3. Inserting Elements‚ûï**

To insert an element into your hash table:

```cpp
const char* key = "exampleKey";
const char* value = "exampleValue";
ht_insert(ht, key, value, strlen(value) + 1); // +1 for NULL terminator
```

To insert a generic element into your hash table:

```cpp
typedef struct Generic{
    uint8_t asciiChar;
    float decimalNum;
    const char* string;
}Generic; // Example of a struct

Generic item = {
    .asciiChar = 'A', .decimalNum = .6f, .string = "Cat"
};

ht_insert(ht, "Cat Generic Item", &item, sizeof(Generic));
```

**4. Retrieving Elementsüîç**

To retrieve an element:

```cpp
Generic* retrieved_value = (Generic*)ht_get_item(ht, "exampleKey");
if(retrieved_value) {
    printf("Value: %s\n", retrieved_value->string);
}
```

**5. Removing Elements‚ùå**

For removing an element:

```cpp
size_t removed = ht_remove(ht, "exampleKey");
if(removed) {
    printf("Successfully removed the key!\n");
}
```

**6. Bulk Operations‚ûï‚ùå**

For bulk insertions:
```cpp
// SENTINEL macro is defined in hash_map.h
KeyValuePair items_to_insert[] = {
    {"key3", "value3", sizeof("value3") + 1},
    {"key4", "value4", sizeof("value4") + 1},
    SENTINEL
};

ht_bulk_insert(ht, items_to_insert, 2); // where 2 is the number of key-value pairs
```
---
**üö®Noteüö®**: Users are asked to either:
- Use the `SENTINEL` as the last element, **or**
- Provide the correct length of the `KeyValuePair` array.
---

For bulk removals:

```cpp
const char* keys_to_remove[] = {"key1", "key2"};
ht_bulk_remove(ht, keys_to_remove, 2); // where 2 is the number of keys
```

**7. Checking Key Presenceüîç**

To ascertain whether a specific key exists within your hash table:
```cpp
bool key_exists = ht_has_key(ht, "Cat Generic Item");
if(key_exists) {
    printf("The key exists in the hash table!\n");
} else {
    printf("The key does not exist in the hash table.\n");
}
```

**8. Printing to Standard Output `stdout`üñ®Ô∏è**
- print_helper is a custom-defined callback function tailored for formatting and presenting each key-value pair in your desired style
```cpp
typedef void (*PrintHelper)(size_t, const char*, const void*);
```

- index: Specifies the position of the key-value pair within the hash table.
- key: Represents the key of the current pair.
- value: Denotes the associated value for the current key.

```cpp
ht_print(ht, print_helper);
```
**9. Custom Resize Policyüìè**

* To enhance the performance of your hash table under varying load factors, you can define custom resize policies. This feature allows you to specify different resize factors that are applied when certain capacity thresholds are crossed, enabling more efficient use of memory and potentially better access patterns.

The ht_set_custom_resize_strategy function allows you to establish these policies dynamically:

    capacity_threshold: A size_t value determining the bucket count at which a resize operation is triggered.

    associated_resize_factor: A float value that indicates the multiplication factor to use for resizing. A factor greater than 1.0 results in the table growing, whereas a factor less than 1.0 will shrink it.

```cpp
HashTable* ht = ht_create(1000, fnv_hash_func, coll_res);

// Up to 25k size, resize factor is 2, doubling the table size at each resize
ht_set_custom_resize_strategy(ht, 25'000, 2);
// Between 25k and 50k size, resize factor is 0.5, reducing the growth rate
ht_set_custom_resize_strategy(ht, 50'000, .5f);
```
Performance comparison example(found in `Testing/coll_res_testing.cpp`)
- Without custom resize policy:
```cpp
time ./coll_res l
Size: 0
All extensive tests passed!
./coll_res l  0.3s user 0.01s system 98% cpu 0.308 total
```

- With custom resize policy:
```cpp
time ./coll_res l
Size: 0
All extensive tests passed!
./coll_res l  0.2s user 0.01s system 98% cpu 0.308 total
```

Use this when needed! Implement custom resize strategies especially when managing `large data sets` to maintain high performance and efficient resource utilization.


**10. Cleanup**

After you're done using the hash table, ensure you free the memory:

```cpp
free_ht(&ht);
```

## üîó Features

**0. Key and Value Constraints:**

Please note that this implementation does not support storing `NULL` for either keys or values. Always ensure that you provide valid, non-null data when interacting with the hash table, 
otherwise you'll get an stdout message.

**1. Collision Resolutions:**  
The heart of any hash table lies in how it addresses collisions. This particular implementation supports three distinct Collision Resolutions:
- **Chaining**
- **Open Addressing**:
  - Linear Probing
  - Quadratic Probing
  - Double Hashing
  - (SOON) Robin Hood

**2. Prime Capacity:**  
The capacity of the hash table is always set to a prime number, ensuring optimal distribution and minimizing collisions.

**3. Flexible Key-Value Pairs:**  
While the keys are restricted to `char*` for simplicity and robustness, the values are generic (`void*` type). This provides a lot of versatility to the users in what they wish to store in the hash table.

**4. Customizable Hash Functions:**  
You're not tied to a specific hash function. You can provide your own function pointer to a custom hash function. Example: 
```cpp
size_t fnv_hash_func(const char* key, size_t capacity);
```

**5. Advanced Techniques:**  
- **Wrap Around Technique**: In open addressing, if the load factor allows, and the desired bucket is full, the table will wrap around and find the first available bucket starting from the beginning.
- **Tombstone Technique**: For deletions, a 'tombstone' is used to mark the spot of a previously occupied bucket.

**6. Bulk Operations**
- **Bulk Removal**: Supported and ready for use.
- **Bulk Insertion**: Supported and ready for use.

## üé® SFML Visualization - WIP
**üö® IMPORTANT üö®**

- **SFML Dependency**: This project relies on SFML specifically for Windows with a 64-bit architecture.
- **Makefile Configuration**: The Makefile is tailored for `make` installed via Chocolatey (from PowerShell).
- ‚ùó **Linux Users**: This will **NOT** compile and execute on Linux systems.

Visualization can make understanding and debugging a hash table much more intuitive. This section is still under active development, but here's what we have:

- **Basic Functionality**: You can visualize how items are being stored and how collisions are resolved.
- **Pagination**: While currently you may need to scroll to see all the buckets, a pagination feature is on the horizon.
- **UI Aesthetics**: It's functional, but yes, I admit, it's a bit on the 'ugly' side for now. Aesthetic improvements are underway!
- **Chaining Visualization**: Planning to add a pop-up box feature for better visualization when hovering over chained buckets.
- **Event Management**: Refinements in progress for better user experience.
